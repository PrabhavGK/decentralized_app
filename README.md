# Decentralized Social Media(
`Consensys Bootcamp Project`

## Introduction

In today’s world, social media has become an integral part of our lives. People use these platforms to share content ranging from personal updates to professional information. For some, it serves as a source of income due to its marketing potential; for others, it’s a space to share creative content, amplify their voices, or connect with the world. Social media has even evolved into a platform for political discourse, with leaders and officials using it to share important updates and ideas. For example, many heads of state use platforms like Twitter to communicate directly with citizens.  

However, despite its benefits, social media faces significant challenges due to its centralized nature. Issues such as password leaks, politically motivated account bans, and advertiser uncertainty about biased ad placements have raised serious concerns. These vulnerabilities highlight the need for a decentralized alternative.  

This project aims to address these issues by creating a fully decentralized social media platform. It provides users with greater security, freedom, and transparency by removing reliance on central authorities, ensuring that the content and user experience remain fair and unbiased.

The platform is a decentralized social media network, similar to Twitter, but built entirely on a decentralized ramework without relying on servers. It leverages a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain to manage all critical logic. Some key features of the platform include:  

- **Secure and User-Friendly Login**: Authentication is handled via MetaMask wallet integration.  
- **Blockchain-Based Access**: Your public address serves as the unique key to access the platform.  
- **Engaging User Profiles**: Profiles are designed to be visually appealing, akin to those on traditional social media platforms.  
- **Intuitive Interface**: The platform is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind.  
- **Commenting System**: Users can engage with posts by leaving comments.  
- **Reporting Mechanism**:  
  - Posts that receive a specified number of reports are reviewed by maintainers for further action.  
  - Reporting requires users to stake a small amount of Ether.  
  - If a reported post is banned by maintainers, the reporter is refunded and rewarded.  
  - If the post is not banned, the staked amount is transferred to the author of the reported post.  
- **Like Feature**: Users can interact with posts by liking them.  
- **Advertisements**:  
  - Users can upload ads (images and links) to reach the platform’s audience for a nominal fee.  
  - Ads are subject to review by maintainers before being approved.  
  - If an ad is rejected, 80% of the fee is refunded to the advertiser.  
- **Maintainer Management**:  
  - Maintainers can be added to the platform to oversee content moderation.  
  - A dedicated maintainer dashboard allows them to take actions such as approving ads and banning posts (only if the required number of reports is met).
